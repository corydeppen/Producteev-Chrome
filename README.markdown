"Producteev will help you manage your tasks from wherever you're comfortable working : E-mail, IM, Web, iPhone, Gmail, Google Calendar..." ...and now Google Chrome.

Producteev Chrome makes it possible to view and edit your existing tasks and create new tasks without having to navigate away from the site you're currently viewing. This should empower you to enter tasks whenever you think of them, regardless of the site you're viewing.

I wanted to make a version of this extension available as soon as possible, so this first release uses the Producteev Google Gadget. I welcome any comments at the support site below if you feel Producteev Chrome could be made more useful by customizing the layout/functionality beyond what the gadget offers.
